                <p> I probably think myself to be the most interesting person in the world, but  I know for a fact that I am definitely the second most interesting, that's indisputable. I beat out Teddy Roosevelt for the number two spot, and that wasn't an easy feat, as he is a formidable opponent...

                 If the object of this project is to effectively display a writeup of hobbies or passions, or heretofore professional experiences, then I will talk about both, as mine are intertwined.

                <p> While I have many passions and hobbies, Politics and Data are fascinating to me. I understand that politics can be polarizing, so I will keep it factual as to my professional journey within it.

                Before she died, my grandmother's request was that I go into politics. At the age of 27, I finally had an opening appear to me via a friend who worked on a political campaign. At this point in time, I was freshly laid off from a law firm as a clerk, and my own side business went under. I was in Columbia, Missouri when a friend called to rave about the campaign of which he was a staffer. 

                    Knowing him, it was a sales pitch. I could tell by the tone in his voice. He used to sell vacuums door to door.

                <p> So my girlfriend at the time and I interviewed separately, each for individual positions as field organizers. We were accepted and they put us as close together as possible, which was quite considerate. We went to Iowa to work on the Bruce Braley 2014 campaign.

                     Here I was; I got in. I found the job and the organization of it to be fascinating. It used to be that you had to be born on the Atlantic Coast with a silver spoon in your mouth to get into politics, but I had questions...

                         <li>How did all of this come about?</li>
                         <li> How was it that we were able to hire kids from the flyover states and allow them to have influence in national politics?</li>
                         <li> How do these programs work?</li>

                    It became apparent to me during my training, and interactions with people involved in Iowa politics that much of this had to do with two people: Former Iowa Senator Tom Harkin and President Barack Obama. Back in the 1980s, Tom Harkin, upon seeing the power of a little UNIX system known as VAN, the Voter Activation Network, saw the potential in keeping a library of registered Democrats both in Iowa and Nationwide.

                    Fast forward to 2008, when Barack Obama became a candidate for the president of the United States of America. As a former community organizer himself, he understood the immense value of going door to door as a surrogate for a candidate or cause, and making honest, personal connections with individuals within a constiuency. And so, with the perfect storm that was the electronic consolidation of information known as the internet, VAN, and Obama's knowledge of what we organizers call Field, Obama was able to create a whole field of work that was not only effective, but, for the first time, it was efficient.

                    No longer were organizers literally calling people in the phone book, at random, starting with the letter "A". We now had a publicly available list of voters to call. With VAN, we are able to keep track of who we call for nightly metrics, how those voters feel, who we may be able to call back later when they have time to volunteer. The Obama campaign helped birth an entire field of work that allowed campaigns to be effective in outreach, to create jobs that have a legitimate purpose, and allowed kids like me to have a chance to work for what they considered to be positive change.

                    Fast forward again to three or four political cycles since 2014. I have worked on a few political campaigns, swore it off entirely every time and jumped right back in every time. The hours are long (12-18 hours a day) for six months straight. I work my way up through the Bernie Sanders campaign, finally reaching the top as a State Field Director, overseeing all strategy for one of the final caucus states, North Dakota. And all the while, I get more and more curious about data, and how it all ties everything together, and how the data is all tied together and presented as a big picture to the layman organizers and directors.

                    So now here I am. I am 32, and I am at LaunchCode, and I want to go back out as a Data Director perhaps.  I would love to go to Wellstone's Data and Analytics Camp, which is a summer program that shows data people of all skill levels how to apply Python and SQL to VAN, and how to become incredibly proficient with VAN and how to create models out of voter data.  But, the more I read about it, the more I realize that I would love to get a job anywhere as a Data Scientist, as it seems like a total rocketship of a ride. It's a career that is logical, but also creative, requires good intuition as well as people skills, all of which I posess. As well, the idea of a Data Scientist is intriguing because it requires an individual to be proficient at many different levels. 
                    One must be proficient at data analysis to decide what data is and is not relevant, front-end development so that the end-user can efficiently cull the pertinent information, and understand it in an efficient manner. As well, one must be proficient at back-end development, so that the information can be efficiently procured by the program for the end-user, as time is often of the essence in making proper business decisions. I want to be skilled at all aspects of programming, and being the strongest link I can be in the data chain, and Data Science would not only grant me that opportunity to master these skillsets, but require these skillsets from me.
